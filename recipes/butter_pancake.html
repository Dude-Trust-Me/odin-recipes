    <p>Sheet pan pancakes are one of my favorite breakfast hacks for busy mornings or <br>
        breakfast meal prep. The buttermilk makes these baked pancakes light, fluffy,<br>
        and oh-so-delicious! This sheet pan pancake recipe can be easily customized by <br>
        adding your favorite fruit or other pancake toppings on top of the batter before <br>
        cooking.</p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 cups baking mix (such as Bisquick®)</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li> 
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li> 
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a sheet pan (approx. 13 <br>
            x18 inches) or jelly roll pan (12x17 inches) with parchment paper. Spray the <br>
            parchment paper with cooking spray.
        <li>Combine baking mix, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon in a <br>
            large mixing bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well combined, but don't <br>
            overmix. Pour batter onto the parchment paper-lined pan.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, 15 to 18 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Remove sheet pan from the oven. Lift the parchment paper with the pancake</li>
    </ol>
